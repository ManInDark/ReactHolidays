# ReactHolidays

![build workflow](https://github.com/manindark/reactholidays/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This is a testing project to try and gauge the capabilities of react, vite and tailwind.

The project uses the [date.nager.at API](https://date.nager.at/Api) to get a list of holidays and then visualizes it.
